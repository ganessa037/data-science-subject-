For some weeks, you will be given _Jupyter notebook_ tutorials in the form of lab coding exercises and other questions discussing on concepts you have learned during lecture. Understanding technical things by coding them out is the best way to learn, so these labs cover a lot of essential topics, making them come alive as you learn."

If you see an asterisk (\\*) next to a cell that doesn't go away, it's likely that the code inside the cell is taking too long to run, and it might be a good time to interrupt the kernel (discussed below). When a cell has finished running, you'll see a number inside the brackets, like: `[1]`. The number corresponds to the order in which you run the cells; so, the first cell you run will show a 1 when it's finished running, the second will show a 2, and so on. \n",

    "2. If that doesn't help, click **Kernel** > **Restart** (In Colab, it's **Runtime** > **Restart runtime**). If you do this, you will have to run your code cells from the start of your notebook up until where you paused your work.\n",
    "3. If that doesn't help, restart your server. First, save your work by clicking **File** at the top left of your screen, then **Save**. Next, shut down the kernel and restart the server all over again (in Colab, it's **Runtime** > **Factory reset runtime**). Then, navigate back to the notebook you were working on.
